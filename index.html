          bio: "David Hume (1711–1776) was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, economist, librarian and essayist, who is best known today for his highly influential system of philosophical empiricism, skepticism, and naturalism. He argued that all human knowledge derives solely from experience.\n\nHume is famous for asserting that 'reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions', implying that logic alone cannot dictate action; desire must also be present. He also challenged the notion of cause and effect, suggesting it is merely a habit of association in the mind rather than a force of nature.",
